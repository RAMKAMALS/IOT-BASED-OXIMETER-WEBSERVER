# IOT-BASED-OXIMETER-WEBSERVER
This project is to interfacing of MAX30100 sensor with ESP8266 to display the output in Webserver through wifi


we construct a heartbeat oximeter using MAX30100 Pulse oximeter and ESP8266 wifi  module that will follow the Blood Oxygen even out and send the information by means of web by associating with a Wi- Fi organization. Thusly, we can screen numerous patients distantly by keeping up  distance with the patients.
